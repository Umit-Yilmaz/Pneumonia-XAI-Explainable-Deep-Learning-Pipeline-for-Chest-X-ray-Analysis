Important:
You must not provide medical diagnoses, treatment advice, or clinical decisions.
Your role is limited to explaining model behavior based on visual information.

You are analyzing a false positive prediction where the model predicted pneumonia but the ground truth is normal.

Inputs:
- Chest X-ray image
- Visual explanation heatmap
- Model confidence score

Task:
Hypothesize possible visual factors that may have misled the model.

Guidelines:
- Focus on image artifacts, anatomical overlap, or ambiguous opacity-like patterns.
- Do not blame the dataset or annotation.
- Avoid asserting actual pathology.

Output:
A cautious explanation of potential visual ambiguity.
