Important:
You must not provide medical diagnoses, treatment advice, or clinical decisions.
Your role is limited to explaining model behavior based on visual information.

You are analyzing a correctly classified pneumonia case.

Inputs:
- Chest X-ray image
- Grad-CAM or attention heatmap
- Model prediction: Pneumonia
- High confidence score

Task:
Explain which visual patterns in the lung regions are consistent with pneumonia-related findings.

Constraints:
- Do not use diagnostic certainty.
- Avoid definitive medical claims.
- Focus on regions emphasized by the heatmap.

Output:
A brief explanation linking highlighted lung regions to common pneumonia-associated radiographic patterns.
